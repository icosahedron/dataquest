# Dataquest Portfolio

This is my portfolio for my Dataquest courses.

While studying Data Science through self study, it can be hard to determine what a good project looks like.  There are things I find interesting, but it's hard to gauge if they are good projects for a portfolio.

Also, when studying Data Science and AI at Georgia Tech, I can't post the projects that I complete there, since that violates the honor code about not sharing answers to assignments.

This left me taking another avenue.  

Dataquest's program is centered around creating a portfolio.  This appealed to me for the reasons above.  Here I post the projects I've completed.

This [Jupyter notebook](dataquest1.ipynb) is a simple example using plain Python to accomplish some rudimentary data analysis.
